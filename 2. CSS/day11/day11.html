        <h1>HANNIBAL - BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>

        <p>
            In the spring of 216 BC, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. By capturing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial sources of supply.Once the Roman Senate resumed their consular elections in 216 BC, they appointed Gaius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus as consuls. 
        </p>
        <h1>AFTERMATH - BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
        <p>
            As a result of this victory, many parts of Italy joined Hannibal's cause. As Polybius notes, "How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae, than those that preceded it can be seen by the behaviour of Rome's allies; before that fateful day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver for the simple reason that they despaired of Roman Power."During that same year, the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while Macedonian King Philip V pledged his support to Hannibalâ€”thus initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed tyrant Hieronymus of Syracuse.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is often argued that, if Hannibal had received proper material reinforcements from Carthage, he might have succeeded with a direct attack upon Rome. Instead, he had to content himself with subduing the fortresses that still held out against him, and the only other notable event of 216 BC was the defection of certain Italian territories, including Capua, the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. However, only a few of the Italian city-states that he had expected to gain as allies defected to him.

        <h1>Ancient Egypt - THE Pharoah</h1>
        <p>
            The Pharoah was a living god.  He was at the top of Ancient Egyptian society.  The pharoah
            was responsible for the well being of his people and was obligated to keep the order. 
            He was all powerful and he spent most of his time at the capital city of Memphis.  Here 
            he administered control of both Lower and Upper Egypt.
        </p>
        <h1>The Tombs of the Pharoahs</h1>
        <p>
            The Pharoah spent most of his life working on his tomb.  The Pharoah's had this busy afterlife
            where they continued to control the universe after their death.  The god Anubis assisted
            the pharoah in the mummfication process.  After the pharoah died he traveled to the underworld
            using the Book of the Dead.
